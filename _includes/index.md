##  Documentation for the Docker Charm

We're excited that you are interested in the Docker Charm. These group(s) of
pages serve as the collective knoweldge of the community developing and
leveraging Juju to deploy and orchestrate their Docker based workloads.

The Docker ecosystem is *rich* with tools, utilities, and cutting edge devops
methodologies. This can be a cumbersome process to learn all of the intriciacies
of the toolchains for end users. The Juju Charm aims to abstract away a lot of
the learning curve with running Docker containers in Production by baking in the
collective knowledge of devops veterans from the community.


#### If you are a Juju user

We recommend you get started by reading the User Documentation. If you have
questions about Juju, we encourage you to browse and familiarize yourself with
the juju user documentation linked above in the header navigation.

#### If you are a Charm developer

The Docker Charm leverages some of the best patterns we have available in
charming today. It exhibits a complex set of routines, with fact aggregation,
inventory checking, cross-host communication, and even these doc pages are part
of the charm itself.

You'll want to get started in the Developer Docs.  Are we missing something?
